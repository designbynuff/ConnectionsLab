# Had Had Had
So I didn't do the suggested 2-sentence story thing, I went for [language nerdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher) instead. Although, I guess this *is* a story and (spoiler) two sentences.
Wanted to try a "click on the thing you need to change in order to change it" kind of interaction, using the click event listener. I also have hints on hover using CSS. 
One last thing I'd like to do (but didn't have time for) is an "enable hints" slider that would toggle the hover effect on and off. Looked up some HTML/CSS toggle switches (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) (https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/toggle-switch-css/) but need to figure out the JS to add/remove hover class from the span elements.
